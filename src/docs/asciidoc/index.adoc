= KFSM - Kotlin Finite-state machine
:toc:
:toclevels: 3

== Introduction
Having used various incarnations of link:http://smc.sourceforge.net/[SMC] over the years we decided to try it again and
discovered it didn't have specific support for Kotlin. Instead of creating a generator for Kotlin we decided to attempt
a Kotlin DSL along with a simple implementation.

The <<Tutorial>> provides examples of how to compose a DSL and FSM.
